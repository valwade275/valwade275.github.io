## Val's GitHub Site

This is a space for my [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history).

### Why Am I Creating This Space?

Over the years, I've collected countless bookmarks, and my Notes app is full of snippets and drafts. 
This wiki is a way for me to liberate my bookmarks and notes from platform-specific apps like browsers, Google Drive, or iCloud. If a platform goes offline, I don't want to lose everything. 
This method puts my little knowledge library into markdown files that can be easily migrated between computers and kept in sync using Git.
