<ul>
  <li>
    <p>You can purchase pre-made go bags and emergency kits from various websites online, make your own, or do a combination of both. At various times of the year (back to school, for example), you can find lots of supplies like batteries, towels, backpacks, power banks, and other goods on sale.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One primary piece of advice I can offer is to buy small things here and there so you don’t have to make a giant haul when an emergency is approaching. During your grocery trips, grab an can or two of veggies for your pantry. Keep extra soap, bandaids, and cold medicine on hand. This way, even if grocery stores run low ahead of a hurricane or freeze, you will have adequate essentials in your home.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You do not have to break your budget to prepare for emergencies! There are lots of fancy gadgets out there, but don’t be discouraged if you can’t afford them. Simple flashlights, mylar blankets, and non-perishables are fine. Just do what works for YOU.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That being said, I do believe a quality generator, portable power station, box fan, portable air conditioner, and portable heater are worth the expense. You do not want to be in a situation where you can’t maintain a comfortable temperature in extreme heat or cold. Think about the needs of small children and elders as well. Do you need to keep medicines refrigerated? Is anyone on oxygen? Plan accordingly!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you can, buy a gas range for your home. An electric stove is useless when the power goes out. Be sure to have a good carbon monoxide monitor as well.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Buy an atlas or road map. A paper one. The GPS on your phone likely won’t work in an emergency, and your usual routes may be unavailable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fill up your gas tank, extra gas cans for your generator, and get cash since ATMs might not work.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Buy a manual can opener, a manual coffee grinder, and a French press or non-electric percolator. These small comforts matter when you are stuck at home with no electricity. Personally, I believe you can never have too many lanterns, candles, hand/foot warmers, and battery-operated fans. If family or friends have to camp out at your place, this helps everyone stay comfortable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Learn a hobby that does not involve electricity or the internet. Know how to do something with your hands! Teach your children to use their hands! Canning, knitting, crocheting, woodworking, etc are all useful skills. At the very least, have some books and puzzles available to keep yourself occupied in an emergency.</p>
