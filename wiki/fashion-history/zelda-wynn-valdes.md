# Zelda Wynn Valdes

One person I think deserves more recognition is [Zelda Wynn Valdes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zelda_Wynn_Valdes). Iâ€™d like to know more about her influence on the industry and her involvement with the [National Association of Fashion & Accessory Designers](https://library.syracuse.edu/digital/guides/n/nat_assoc_fash_acc.htm). 

_Reminder: Research her connections to other costumers and creatives._
