# Historic Downtowns in Texas

One thing I'd like to do within the next year or so is to document some of the historic downtowns around Houston and throughout East Texas. Last year, I happened upon a really cool little bar in Old Humble. As long as I've lived here, I've never had a reason to explore that part of Humble, and I was really surprised that the historic main street was still (relatively) intact so close to Highway 59. 

The [Texas Historical Commission](https://thc.texas.gov/) has a lot of resources that you can use to search for towns by name. They also have a search for [state historic markers](https://atlas.thc.texas.gov/), so taking a tour of these little downtowns wouldn't be too difficult. 

Some of my fondest memories include walking around downtown Center, TX when I was a little girl. I remember seeing [Dick Tracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Tracy_(1990_film)) and [The Rocketeer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rocketeer_(film)) in the Rio Theater.
