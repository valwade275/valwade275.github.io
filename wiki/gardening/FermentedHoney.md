# Fermented Honey as a Preservation Method
### July 2024

I have an abundance of jalapeno peppers from this season's harvest. I've cooked with a few (they've been delicious on pizza), but there's only so much spice I feel like tasting when it's 95 degrees + 95% humidity outside. So I think it's a good idea to make something versatile and long-lasting with them. Fermented honey is also closely related to [fire cider](gardening/FireCider.md), so I'll probably start both at the same time since I'll be chopping things anyway. 

## Why Fermented Honey?
- Fermented foods have plenty of health benefits. 
- The ingredients and directions are minimal. **Be sure to use RAW UNPASTEURIZED honey!** 
- It's easy to experiment with different combinations (garlic, ginger, turmeric, fruits, etc.). 
- The risk of botulism is quite low. (You can test the acidity or add a bit of lemon juice or vinegar as a safeguard.)  
    - Remember: Do NOT give honey to babies under one year old!

## Let's Do This!
Here are some simple instructions from [The Fermentary](https://www.thefermentary.com.au/blogs/recipes/honey-ferments).  
    1. Wash your fruit, peel your garlic or whatever you're using. When it comes to fruit like Nectarine and Quince, I leave the peel on.  
    2. Place in a very clean jar.  
    3. Pour honey over this, leaving a quarter of the jar as head room.  
    4. Seal with clean lid and if you're not using an air lock system, place the jar on a little plate and make sure to burp now and then.  
    5. For the first week, every time you go by your jar, give it a tip - like a snow globe - to make sure the fruit is covered, and also so you can enjoy watching the honey get thinner.  
    6. Ferment for as long as you like.

## Tips
 - Consider using a glass jar with a plastic lid to prevent rust. 
 - Leave plenty of space at the top of the jar (at least 25%) to avoid spillage as the mixture bubbles and expands.  
 - Turning the jar upside down and burping it are beneficial during the first week or so. Stirring after the first week is helpful as well.
